2022 was a monster year for music released that really resenated with me. Black Country, New Road released what I would consider to be a Top 5 album for me of all time. We had tickets to go see them and with the unfortunate departure of the lead singer caused cancellations. I have a suspicion this will be one of those "bucket list" moments. This year was also met with some amazing travel and also began a tradition where I will save an album for the trip to hammer in some nostalgia - like listening to Toro y Moi riding a high speed train to Madrid.
