2020 was a peculiar year thus my top songs from this year should reflect that. I recall how excited I was for music this year especially considering we ushered in the new year seeing Helio Sequence live at the Doug Fir Lounge in Portland, OR. There was definitely a buzz of music excitement that was quickly up-ended with COVID and the subsequent lockdowns. This began a tradition with our good friend, John where every Friday we would have a few beers and binge watch music videos, all taking turns queuing up our next selections. Brutal year but the tunes to keep me, my family and friends sane.
