2006 - 2007. It was a simpler time. I was one step out of the door into adult hood and was in my second year of university. This was pre-streaming. Burned CDs, early gen iPods, and the high seas. Ahoy! When streaming became commonplace, my very first playlist included these tracks and mapped to my college years. At the time, my taste in music was focused and could be considered... elementary. That said, nostalgia drips off this mixtape and marks the beginning of the journey.
